What

    Mingler.js is a small, easy to use and lightweight Dependency Injection container, like Guice, but for JavaScript.

Why

    In my recent projects, we were writing a lot of JavaScript and we were using module pattern to organize our JS files.
    And we used kind of a Main module to wire all the other modules together.
    This Main module is pretty much just a bunch of function calls to initialize all the modules and will take care of the dependent relationships among modules.
    It is not really that bad given the flexibility of JavaScript, but it is trivial and boring stuff and it is not really good having to repeat this on each project.
    Something like a Dependency Injection container would be very helpful here, I didn't find any hence the born of this little library.

How

  Define a module:

    Mingler.module("name", {
	factory: // function used to initialize the module
	dependencies: // optional dependencies of this module
    })

    module() function can be used to define a module.
    The definition object passed in as the second parameter is used to provide some meta info about this module.
    * It must have a "factory" property, which must be a function and will be called when container is starting up.
      Its return value will be hold as the value of this module.
    * "dependencies" property is optional. There are tow ways to specify dependencies:
        1. as an array of dependency names: "factory" function will be called with all dependencies
           passed as the parameters in the same order as specified in the array;
        2. as an dependency object: "factory" will be called with a dependency object as the sole parameter. see below examples.

  Get a module: Mingler.module("name")

  Get a definition: Mingler.definition("name")

  Start container: Mingler.mingle() or Mingler.start()

Examples

    // define some modules
    Mingler.module("module1", {
        factory: function() {
            return "module1!";
        }
    });

    Mingler.module("module2", {
        factory: function(module1) {
            return "module2, depends on " + module;
        }
        dependencies: ["module1"]
    });

    Mingler.module("module3", {
        factory: function(deps) {
            return "module3, depends on [" + deps.m1 + "] and [" + deps.m2 + "]";
        }
        dependencies: {
            m1: "module1",
            m2: "module2"
        }
    });
